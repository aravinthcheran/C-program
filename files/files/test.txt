attitude is everything
being calm helps you to think clearly and make better decisions
you can't control other people, but you can control how you respond to them
you can't control the economy, but you can control your spending and saving habits
you can't control the past, but you can control the present and the future
you can't control the traffic, but you can control your reaction to ityou can't control the weather, but you can control your attitude about it
you can't control what happens to you, but you can control how you react to it
